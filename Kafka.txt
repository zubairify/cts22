- These event are organised and stored in Topics.

Server
Broker
Client
Consumer
Producer

- Kafka client talks to Kafka Broker via Network (As everything is distributed)
	- For writing or reading events / messages
- The broker will store the events in a robust environment within distributed system
	- Durable
	- Fault Tolerant

Zookeeper:
- Its an environment designed by Apache
- It acts as a centralised service and used to maintain naming and configuration data
	- Of applications running inside it
- Provides robust and flexible synchronisation within distributed system
- All other apache services like Hadoop and Kafka uses Zookeeper for distributed systems
